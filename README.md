Looking for more UI and less CLI? Try out the new [Siera Desktop](https://siera.animo.id/desktop) application.

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/animo/siera-cli/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=RMWG6Y4J8Y)](https://codecov.io/gh/animo/siera-cli)

Siera is the most convenient way for self-sovereign identity (SSI) developers to interact with SSI agents.

- **Environments** to easily manage configuration for multiple projects and agents
- **Automations** that you can perform against an agent
- **Mock data** so that you can focus on the important task of building your application instead of other foobar (coming soon 🚧)

If you are looking for more information about the concepts, example code and tutorials on how to use the CLI we recommend you check out our extensive [docs](https://docs.siera.animo.id/).

## Installation

Heres how to install Siera using the most popular package managers. For advanced installation options, binaries and troubleshooting we recommend checking out the [installation guide](https://docs.siera.animo.id/guides/installation).

### macOS using Brew

```sh
brew tap animo/siera
brew install siera
```

### Cargo install

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/animo/siera-cli
```

### Manual build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/animo/siera-cli
cd siera-cli

# Run ONE of the following commands to build:
make build

cargo build --release

# Run ONE of the following commands to add install the siera into your PATH
make install

cargo install --path .

```

## Getting started

In order to work with Siera an agent needs to be configured. With the following command you connect with our community agent and can access all the functionality.

```sh
siera configuration add --default
```

This command will set up the community agent. To set up your own agent or use our multi-tenant agent to get your own environment, see the [set up guide](https://docs.siera.animo.id/guides/configuration).

If you are getting started with the tool we recommend enabling informational logs by passing the `--verbose` (or `-v`) flag.

To see all actions simply use the `--help` or `-h` flag or see the [feature overview](https://docs.siera.animo.id/features/introduction).

## Roadmap

We intend to support multiple versions of the Aries agent. See the CLI help `siera --help` for a list of actions we currently support.
